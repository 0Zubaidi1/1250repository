    The Uber app is very well designed in my opinion because it eases the users' experience and makes commuting very
    straightforward and easy. Uber first promps you to select a location you want go to. After that, you select what size car
    you want, and the payment method. With the push of a button, it connects you to nearby drivers who will pick you up from
    your location, and drop you off at your desired destination. Its clever design removes the hassle of finding a taxi, as it
    acts as a middleman that connects drivers to passengers.

    It is critical to design software with the end user in mind. A crucial element of designing any piece of software is
    ensuring its ease of use and reliability. In general, software is designed to solve an existing problem. If you keep that
    in mind, the user can easily navigate through your software and get what they need out of it hassle-free.

  <h1>Writing Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>Gathering information is a crucial part of designing any software. It is vital to know the needs of your customers.
    How can you be sure that you’re addressing all their concerns and creating software that works for them?
    So far in the requirements gathering state, we asked the end-user what they are looking for in our software,
    and what their priorities are in terms of features we need to implement. This helps us focus on what to shift our attention towards,
    what to sideline for the time being, and what our goals should be for the future.

    Software design as a process requires input and feedback as much as it needs designers and developers. Software engineers
    need to be ‘in touch’ and know their audience well. Thus, we asked teachers what they need for our online grading and
    assignments posting platform (Courselink), and will decide what to do next based on their feedback and criteria.

  1. As a user, I want to be able to select 'comfort' choices beforehand, such as temperature inside the car and more, so that I can
  have the most comfortable experience possible.
  2. As a user, I want to choose wether my Driver will talk to me or have a quiet ride, so that I can either enjoy the silence if I need
  or enjoy their company.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to choose drivers based on an 'accident report,' so that I can prioritize my safety (even if it costs
  extra).
  4. As a user, I want tips to be payable only after the ride, so that I know the driver will offer the best experience before they know
  the amount of my tip.
  5. As a user, I want to have feature that tracks my location live and if I go off course, to immediately alert my emergency contacts,
  so that I be be sure I am safe at all times.
