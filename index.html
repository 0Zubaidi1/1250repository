    The Uber app is very well designed in my opinion because it eases the users' experience and makes commuting very
    straightforward and easy. Uber first promps you to select a location you want go to. After that, you select what size car
    you want, and the payment method. With the push of a button, it connects you to nearby drivers who will pick you up from
    your location, and drop you off at your desired destination. Its clever design removes the hassle of finding a taxi, as it
    acts as a middleman that connects drivers to passengers.

    It is critical to design software with the end user in mind. A crucial element of designing any piece of software is
    ensuring its ease of use and reliability. In general, software is designed to solve an existing problem. If you keep that
    in mind, the user can easily navigate through your software and get what they need out of it hassle-free.
